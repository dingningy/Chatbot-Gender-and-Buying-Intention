However, it did not ask for any specifics I need or my budget, so the suggestion was not exactly the type I had in mind. I noticed that more specific inputs do generate more specific tailored suggestions, though.",24

It also didn't know the metal used in the bakery set which i think is important. Other than this I lived using it and a nice touch would be the bot being able to add an item to my cart after we discuss it. I also love the detailed response on warranty and returns.",27
